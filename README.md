# Classic 5x5 – Base + Powers UI (React)

This is the same UI from the original HTML/CSS mock, converted to a React app.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Notes

- Styling is kept 1:1 by using the original `public/css/styles.css`.
- All assets live in `public/assets`.
- The missing card images in the original zip were duplicated from `c01.jpg` so all `c02..c25` references work.
